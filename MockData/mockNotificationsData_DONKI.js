      "## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (CCMC DONKI)\n## Message Type: Weekly Space Weather Summary Report for December 20, 2023 - December 26, 2023\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-12-27T21:38:36Z\n## Report Coverage Begin Date: 2023-12-20T00:00Z\n## Report Coverage End Date: 2023-12-26T23:59Z\n## Message ID: 20231227-7D-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts. This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at minor to moderate levels during this reporting period with 5 M-class flares and 9 C-type CMEs (see details below).\n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-12-24T13:25Z may give a glancing blow to NASA missions near Earth at about 2023-12-28T01:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index of 3-4 (below minor) (see notification 20231224-AL-001).\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact the following locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-12-21T06:09Z    OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-22T15:36Z (see notification 20231221-AL-003).\n2023-12-22T00:24Z    OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-23T19:07Z (see notification 20231222-AL-001).\n2023-12-22T01:25Z    OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-23T19:07Z (see notification 20231222-AL-001). \n2023-12-22T05:12Z    OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-23T19:07Z (see notification 20231222-AL-001).\n2023-12-24T13:25Z    Solar Orbiter at 2023-12-27T13:00Z (glancing blow) and STEREO A at 2023-12-28T02:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20231224-AL-001).\n2023-12-26T00:12Z    OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-27T18:07Z (see notification 20231226-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp<=4 occurred during the synoptic period of 2023-12-20T00:00Z-03:00Z. This slight enhancement in geomagnetic activity was associated with the possible arrival of the S-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-12-16T01:48Z detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-12-20T00:26Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-12-21T13:35Z (see notifications 20231221-AL-001, 20231221-AL-002, and 20231223-AL-001) and remained elevated until returning to background levels early on 2023-12-24. These elevated energetic electron flux levels are likely associated with the combined arrivals of the CME first seen at 2023-12-14T17:38Z detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2023-12-17T07:32Z (see notification 20231221-7D-001), a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-12-18, and the CME first seen at 2023-12-16T01:48Z detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-12-20T00:26Z mentioned above.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A remained near or slightly above background levels for the entire reporting period. The slight elevation seen at GOES may be associated to recent M-class flaring activity and CMEs departing the Sun from on and/or beyond the western side of the Earth-facing disk. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-12-21  05:19:00  05:49:00  05:38:00   M4.2   S11W61 ( 13519 ) \n2023-12-21  23:42:00  00:19:00  00:04:00   M3.3   S12W72 ( 13519 ) \n2023-12-24  11:09:00  11:24:00  11:18:00   M2.9   S20W25 ( 13529 ) \n2023-12-24  16:37:00  16:56:00  16:49:00   M2.6   S20W30 ( 13529 ) \n2023-12-24  19:21:00  20:16:00  19:51:00   M1.1   S23E90           \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-24T13:25Z     ~790            C                 3/51                38                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-20T00:24Z     ~584            C                95/-8                32                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-21T06:09Z     ~634            C                61/-7                30                          STEREO A                          \n2023-12-22T00:24Z     ~621            C                72/-11               22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-22T01:25Z     ~591            C                60/-1                16                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-22T05:12Z     ~564            C                71/0                 24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-24T17:00Z     ~616            C               -85/37                30                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-25T13:25Z     ~766            C               102/38                36                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-26T00:12Z     ~539            C                70/-1                15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-12-27T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-01-02T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels for the outlook period. There are currently five Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. The most notable of these, Active Region 13529 (S21W62), produced two of the M-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to exhibit similar levels of activity during the outlook period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be minor for the upcoming week. A large coronal hole currently centered near S15E25 (stretching from N10E10 to S30E50) will begin to cross the central meridian by the end of 2023-12-28. The western most portions of this coronal hole may reach geoeffective longitudes by the end of the outlook period. We are still awaiting the potential glancing blow of the C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-12-24T13:25Z where minor geomagnetic conditions are possible.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n",

This "Experimental Research Information" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at high levels during this reporting period with 1 X-class flare, 5 M-class flares, 7 C-type CMEs, and 2 O-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-12-13T00:00Z associated with a C2.8 flare from AR 13514 (N06W25) peaking at 2023-12-12T22:55Z may impact NASA missions near Earth at about 2023-12-15T15:13Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index of 3-5 (below minor to minor) (see notification 20231213-AL-002). The arrival of this CME was likely detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2023-12-15T10:57Z (see notification 20231215-AL-006). STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments have also likely detected the arrival of this CME around 2023-12-15T12:41Z. \n\nAdditionally, it was estimated that the O-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 imagery at 2023-12-14T17:38Z associated with an X2.8 flare from AR 13514 (N05W54) peaking at 2023-12-14T17:02Z (see notifications 20231214-AL-005, 20231214-AL-006) may impact NASA missions near Earth at about 2023-12-16T18:51Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index of 5-7 (minor to strong) (see notifications 20231214-AL-007, 20231215-AL-001, and 20231216-AL-002). An ensemble simulation was performed for this CME with 24 members which estimated the CME to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-12-16T15:53Z and 2023-12-17T09:58Z (average arrival 2023-12-16T22:15Z) for 75% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 79% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-6 range (below minor to moderate). Full details of the modeled event are available here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-12-16_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA055/Detailed_results_20231214_173800_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA055.txt (see notification 20231216-AL-002). The arrival of this CME was likely detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2023-12-17T07:32Z (see notification 20231217-AL-002). STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments also likely detected the arrival of this CME around 2023-12-17T00:30Z.\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact the following locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-12-13T00:00Z   OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-14T09:08Z, Psyche at 2023-12-16T07:15Z, Solar Orbiter at 2023-12-15T15:06Z, STEREO A at 2023-12-15T13:13Z (see notification 20231213-AL-002)\n2023-12-13T15:05Z   OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-15T09:47Z (see notification 20231215-AL-001)\n2023-12-14T07:00Z   OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-15T18:00Z (see notification 20231215-AL-001)\n2023-12-14T08:36Z   OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-15T18:00Z (see notifications 20231215-AL-001)\n2023-12-14T17:38Z   OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-15T18:00Z, Psyche at 2023-12-17T08:42Z, Solar Orbiter at 2023-12-16T23:48Z, STEREO A = 2023-12-16T16:59Z (see notifications 20231215-AL-001 and 20231216-AL-002).\n2023-12-15T07:48Z   OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-16T10:44Z, STEREO A at 2023-12-18T07:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20231215-AL-009)\n2023-12-17T18:36Z   Lucy = 2023-12-23T00:00Z (minor impact)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6 for the reporting period (see notifications 20231218-AL-001 and 20231218-AL-002). The highest value of Kp=6 occurred during the synoptic period 2023-12-18T06:00Z-09:00Z. This moderate geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-12-17T07:32Z (see notification 20231217-AL-002) which was likely associated with the arrival of the O-type CME first seen in STEREO A COR2 imagery at 2023-12-14T17:38Z (see notifications 20231214-AL-007, 20231215-AL-001, and 20231216-AL-002). Simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2023-12-17T10:54Z (see notifications 20231217-AL-001 and 20231217-AL-003).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period.\n\nAdditionally, there was a solar energetic particle event detected by SOHO and GOES. At SOHO, the flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2023-12-15T15:42Z (see notification 20231215-AL-008). At GOES, the flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2023-12-15T23:45Z (see notifications 20231215-AL-010 and 20231216-AL-001). This solar energetic particle event is likely associated with and influenced by several preceding events which collectively contributed to the observed enhancements. Such events include the observed X2.8, M6.3, and M6.9 flares from Active Region 13514 on 2023-12-14 and 2023-12-15 (see Flares section below for more details), the CMEs first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-12-12T00:00Z, 2023-12-13T00:00Z, and 2023-12-15T07:48Z in addition to the the CME first seen in STEREO A COR2 at 2023-12-14T17:38Z (see CMEs table below for more details), and the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-12-17T07:32Z (see notification 20231217-AL-002). The energetic proton flux of 13-100 MeV protons detected at STEREO A was elevated during the reporting period, but remained below the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV. On 2023-12-17, the particle environment subsided to background levels at all locations and subsequently remained at background levels through the remainder of the reporting period.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this week due to the solar energetic particle events detected at SOHO and GOES.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-12-14  07:11:00  08:00:00  07:44:00   M5.8   N05W50 ( 13514 ) \n2023-12-14  13:29:00  14:08:00  13:48:00   M2.3   N05W52 ( 13514 ) \n2023-12-14  16:47:00  17:12:00  17:02:00   X2.8   N05W54 ( 13514 ) \n2023-12-15  07:03:00  07:23:00  07:15:00   M6.3   N03W59 ( 13514 ) \n2023-12-15  07:23:00  07:43:00  07:34:00   M6.9   N02W66 ( 13514 ) \n2023-12-17  20:08:00  20:21:00  20:17:00   M1.1   N05W90 ( 13514 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-13T00:00Z     ~696            C                17/2                 36                          SOHO, STEREO A                                \n2023-12-14T17:38Z     ~1081           O                33/-4                49                          STEREO A, SOHO                          \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-13T15:05Z     ~616            C                59/8                 27                          SOHO, STEREO A                     \n2023-12-14T07:00Z     ~684            C                83/-30               37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-14T08:36Z     ~517            C                50/-18               13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-15T07:48Z     ~1101           O                60/-22               37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-16T05:48Z     ~676            C         NONE(POS)/0                 27                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-17T18:12Z     ~558            C         NONE(POS)/71                28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-17T18:36Z     ~691            C               100/-2                29                          SOHO, STEREO A      \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-12-20T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-12-26T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and moderate levels during the outlook period.

The highest value of Kp = 4.0 occurred during the synoptic period of 2023-12-12T12:00-15:00Z and was likely associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-12-12T11:26Z (see notification 20231212-AL-001). This interplanetary shock was also detected by STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC at 2023-12-13T00:00Z following a data gap that started around 2023-12-12T22:00Z. Analysis of this arrival signature is ongoing. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-12-07T16:25Z (see notifications 20231207-AL-001, 20231207-AL-002, 20231209-AL-001, and 20231211-AL-001) and remained elevated throughout the reporting period until returning to background levels at the end of 2023-12-12. These elevated energetic electron flux levels are associated with the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream at L1 on 2023-12-03 and the possible arrival of the CME with ID 2023-12-01T22:24Z detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2023-12-04T04:30Z during the previous reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-12-06  05:30:00  05:52:00  05:41:00   M2.1   N19E65 ( 13513 ) \n2023-12-06  21:26:00  21:55:00  21:44:00   M2.3   N19E55 ( 13513 ) \n2023-12-08  22:57:00  23:14:00  23:07:00   M5.4   S21W50 ( 13511 ) \n2023-12-09  09:41:00  10:06:00  09:55:00   M1.5   S22W57 ( 13511 ) \n2023-12-09  13:03:00  13:37:00  13:19:00   M1.0   S22W58 ( 13511 ) \n2023-12-10  03:42:00  03:58:00  03:53:00   M2.3   S22W67 ( 13511 ) \n2023-12-10  22:37:00  22:47:00  22:43:00   M1.4   S21W77 ( 13511 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-06T08:12Z     ~506            C                 7/24                17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-06T00:12Z     ~810            C                 1/43                24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-07T00:48Z     ~500            C               180/82                39                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-07T13:36Z     ~966            C               163/16                37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-08T02:00Z     ~561            C               100/-55               21                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-08T16:24Z     ~650            C               160/31                40                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-09T04:24Z     ~933            C               164/78                38                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-10T11:23Z     ~566            C              -165/-34               36                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-10T19:12Z     ~943            C              -116/-28               37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-12-13T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-12-19T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at low to moderate levels during the outlook period.

Active Region 13513 (currently located at N18W40) produced two M-class flares during the reporting period and may produce additional flaring activity before rotating off the Earth-facing disk on or around 2023-12-17. Active Region 13514 (currently located at N10W34) has been the source of numerous C-class flares during the reporting period and is likely to produce further flaring activity during the outlook period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. An equatorial coronal hole structure currently centered near S15W30 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) could become geoeffective early in the outlook period on or around 2023-12-14. An additional increase in geomagnetic activity may be observed around 2023-12-15 due to the anticipated combined arrival of an S-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-12-12T00:00Z and a C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-12-13T00:00Z (see notification 20231213-AL-002).

These elevated energetic electron flux levels are associated with the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream at L1 on 2023-12-03 and the possible arrival of the CME with ID 2023-12-01T22:24Z detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2023-12-04T04:30Z during the previous reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-12-06  05:30:00  05:52:00  05:41:00   M2.1   N19E65 ( 13513 ) \n2023-12-06  21:26:00  21:55:00  21:44:00   M2.3   N19E55 ( 13513 ) \n2023-12-08  22:57:00  23:14:00  23:07:00   M5.4   S21W50 ( 13511 ) \n2023-12-09  09:41:00  10:06:00  09:55:00   M1.5   S22W57 ( 13511 ) \n2023-12-09  13:03:00  13:37:00  13:19:00   M1.0   S22W58 ( 13511 ) \n2023-12-10  03:42:00  03:58:00  03:53:00   M2.3   S22W67 ( 13511 ) \n2023-12-10  22:37:00  22:47:00  22:43:00   M1.4   S21W77 ( 13511 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-06T08:12Z     ~506            C                 7/24                17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-06T00:12Z     ~810            C                 1/43                24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-07T00:48Z     ~500            C               180/82                39                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-07T13:36Z     ~966            C               163/16                37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-08T02:00Z     ~561            C               100/-55               21                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-08T16:24Z     ~650            C               160/31                40                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-09T04:24Z     ~933            C               164/78                38                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-10T11:23Z     ~566            C              -165/-34               36                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-10T19:12Z     ~943            C              -116/-28               37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-12-13T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-12-19T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at low to moderate levels during the outlook period.

These elevated energetic electron flux levels are associated with the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream at L1 on 2023-12-03 and the possible arrival of the CME with ID 2023-12-01T22:24Z detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2023-12-04T04:30Z during the previous reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-12-06  05:30:00  05:52:00  05:41:00   M2.1   N19E65 ( 13513 ) \n2023-12-06  21:26:00  21:55:00  21:44:00   M2.3   N19E55 ( 13513 ) \n2023-12-08  22:57:00  23:14:00  23:07:00   M5.4   S21W50 ( 13511 ) \n2023-12-09  09:41:00  10:06:00  09:55:00   M1.5   S22W57 ( 13511 ) \n2023-12-09  13:03:00  13:37:00  13:19:00   M1.0   S22W58 ( 13511 ) \n2023-12-10  03:42:00  03:58:00  03:53:00   M2.3   S22W67 ( 13511 ) \n2023-12-10  22:37:00  22:47:00  22:43:00   M1.4   S21W77 ( 13511 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-06T08:12Z     ~506            C                 7/24                17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-06T00:12Z     ~810            C                 1/43                24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-07T00:48Z     ~500            C               180/82                39                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-07T13:36Z     ~966            C               163/16                37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-08T02:00Z     ~561            C               100/-55               21                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-08T16:24Z     ~650            C               160/31                40                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-09T04:24Z     ~933            C               164/78                38                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-10T11:23Z     ~566            C              -165/-34               36                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-10T19:12Z     ~943            C              -116/-28               37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-12-13T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-12-19T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at low to moderate levels during the outlook period.

These elevated energetic electron flux levels are associated with the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream at L1 on 2023-12-03 and the possible arrival of the CME with ID 2023-12-01T22:24Z detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2023-12-04T04:30Z during the previous reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-12-06  05:30:00  05:52:00  05:41:00   M2.1   N19E65 ( 13513 ) \n2023-12-06  21:26:00  21:55:00  21:44:00   M2.3   N19E55 ( 13513 ) \n2023-12-08  22:57:00  23:14:00  23:07:00   M5.4   S21W50 ( 13511 ) \n2023-12-09  09:41:00  10:06:00  09:55:00   M1.5   S22W57 ( 13511 ) \n2023-12-09  13:03:00  13:37:00  13:19:00   M1.0   S22W58 ( 13511 ) \n2023-12-10  03:42:00  03:58:00  03:53:00   M2.3   S22W67 ( 13511 ) \n2023-12-10  22:37:00  22:47:00  22:43:00   M1.4   S21W77 ( 13511 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-06T08:12Z     ~506            C                 7/24                17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-06T00:12Z     ~810            C                 1/43                24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-07T00:48Z     ~500            C               180/82                39                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-07T13:36Z     ~966            C               163/16                37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-08T02:00Z     ~561            C               100/-55               21                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-08T16:24Z     ~650            C               160/31                40                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-09T04:24Z     ~933            C               164/78                38                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-10T11:23Z     ~566            C              -165/-34               36                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-10T19:12Z     ~943            C              -116/-28               37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-12-13T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-12-19T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at low to moderate levels during the outlook period.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at minor levels during this reporting period with 7 M-class flares and 9 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-12-06T08:12Z may give a glancing blow to NASA missions near Earth at about 2023-12-09T16:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index of 2-3 (below minor) (see notifications 20231206-AL-001 and 20231207-AL-003). The arrival of this CME was not detected at L1.\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact the following locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-12-06T08:12Z    OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-08T03:00Z (glancing blow), Psyche at 2023-12-10T05:00Z (glancing blow), STEREO-A at 2023-12-09T12:00Z (glancing blow) (see notifications 20231206-AL-001 and 20231207-AL-003).\n2023-12-07T13:36Z    Mars at 2023-12-10T20:18Z, and Lucy at 2023-12-13T02:00Z (glancing blow) (see notifications 20231207-AL-004 and 20231207-AL-005).\n2023-12-08T16:24Z    Mars at 2023-12-12T21:04Z. \n2023-12-12T19:12Z    Parker Solar Probe at 2023-12-13T22:05Z (see notification 20231213-AL-001). \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4.0 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 4.0 occurred during the synoptic period of 2023-12-12T12:00-15:00Z and was likely associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-12-12T11:26Z (see notification 20231212-AL-001). This interplanetary shock was also detected by STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC at 2023-12-13T00:00Z following a data gap that started around 2023-12-12T22:00Z.
